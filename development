Features that need to be added first:
    1) Ordering multiple glasses under one order number
    3) Some kind of main page design - counting of completed doors and windows


JSON data architecture:
    1) One JSON file for the whole inventory
    2) Three separate JSON files for each door and window type,
    which contains the names of the door/window and the material which
    that door/window is made out of
    3) One JSON file for Inventory

Adding of orders:
    1) Some kind of bigger object (identified by order number or something similar), which contains all
    of the glasses ordered, so that each ordered glass doesn't have to be picked manually, when the order
    has arrived. Only the order number is picked, when it has arrived.
    2) For materials, there are standard containers.
