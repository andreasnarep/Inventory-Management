Features that need to be added first:
    1) Inventory page
    2) Adding completed doors and windows, both BQ and polo
    3) Some kind of main page design - counting of completed doors and windows


JSON data architecture:
    1) One JSON file for the whole inventory
    2) Three separate JSON files for each door and window type,
    which contains the names of the door/window and the material which
    that door/window is made out of
